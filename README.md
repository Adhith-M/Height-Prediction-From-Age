## Description

This project implements a machine learning model to predict human height based on age. Utilizing the Decision Tree algorithm, it provides a clear demonstration of a regression task within the realm of supervised learning. The core of the project is a Jupyter Notebook that guides through data loading, exploration, model training, and evaluation using a simple dataset (`dataset.csv`). It's designed to be an accessible example for understanding how predictive models can be built and applied to real-world data.

## Features

*   **Height Prediction:** Predicts human height based on age using a machine learning model.
*   **Decision Tree Algorithm:** Implements and utilizes the Decision Tree Regressor for predictive modeling.
*   **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Handles loading data from a CSV file and preparing it for model training.
*   **Model Training:** Trains the Decision Tree model on the provided dataset.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the performance of the trained model.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Jupyter Notebook format allows for step-by-step execution and visualization of the process.

## Tech Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive computing, data analysis, and model development.
*   **Pandas:** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Scikit-learn:** A comprehensive machine learning library, used here for the Decision Tree Regressor.
*   **Matplotlib / Seaborn (Inferred):** Commonly used for data visualization within Jupyter Notebooks to understand data and model performance.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Height-Prediction-From-Age.git
    cd Height-Prediction-From-Age
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project, train the model, and see the predictions.

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook:**
    In the Jupyter interface that opens in your web browser, navigate to and click on `15_HeightPredictionFromAge_DECISIONTREE.ipynb`.

3.  **Run the Cells:**
    Execute the cells sequentially within the notebook to load the data, train the model, and observe the results.
