## Description

This project implements a machine learning model to predict human height based on age. Utilizing a Decision Tree algorithm, the core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook that guides through the entire process from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction. The `dataset.csv` file contains the necessary data for training and testing the model. This repository serves as a clear, executable example of applying a Decision Tree for a regression task.

## Features

*   **Height Prediction:** Predicts height using age as an input feature.
*   **Decision Tree Model:** Implements and utilizes a Decision Tree Regressor for the prediction task.
*   **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Handles loading of data from `dataset.csv` and prepares it for model training.
*   **Model Training:** Trains the Decision Tree model on the provided dataset.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the performance of the trained model.
*   **Interactive Analysis:** Jupyter Notebook format allows for step-by-step execution, visualization, and interactive exploration of the data and model.

## Tech Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development, execution, and documentation of the code.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms, specifically the Decision Tree Regressor.
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** (Inferred) For data visualization and plotting results.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Height-Prediction-From-Age.git
    cd Height-Prediction-From-Age
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username if known, otherwise keep as is.)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the above packages and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.*

## Usage

To run the project and explore the height prediction model:

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook:**
    In the Jupyter interface that opens in your web browser, navigate to and click on `15_HeightPredictionFromAge_DECISIONTREE.ipynb`.

3.  **Execute Cells:**
    Run the cells sequentially within the notebook to load the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
