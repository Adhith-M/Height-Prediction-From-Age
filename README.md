## Description

This project explores the fascinating relationship between age and human height, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict an individual's height based on their age. Specifically, it implements a Decision Tree Regressor model, a powerful and interpretable algorithm, to learn patterns from a given dataset (`dataset.csv`). The core of this project is encapsulated within a Jupyter Notebook, providing a step-by-step walkthrough of data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a student learning about regression models, or simply curious about applying machine learning to real-world data, this repository offers a clear and practical example.

## Features

*   **Height Prediction:** Predicts human height using age as an input feature.
*   **Decision Tree Regressor:** Implements a robust Decision Tree model for regression tasks.
*   **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Demonstrates how to load and prepare tabular data for machine learning.
*   **Model Training:** Trains the Decision Tree model on the provided dataset.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics.
*   **Interactive Analysis:** Jupyter Notebook format allows for interactive exploration and visualization of data and model results.
*   **Dataset Included:** Comes with a sample `dataset.csv` for immediate use.

## Tech Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for data manipulation and machine learning.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive computing environment for developing and presenting data science projects.
*   **Pandas:** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
*   **Scikit-learn:** A comprehensive machine learning library, used here for the Decision Tree Regressor.
*   **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** Libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Height-Prediction-From-Age.git
    cd Height-Prediction-From-Age
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the actual GitHub username if this project were hosted.)*

2.  **Install required Python packages:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can open and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project.

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook:**
    Your web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter dashboard. Navigate to and click on `15_HeightPredictionFromAge_DECISIONTREE.ipynb`.

3.  **Run the Cells:**
    Execute the cells sequentially within the notebook to load the data, train the model, and view the predictions and evaluations.
