To create a height prediction section based on age for a GitHub README, you'll need to include a brief explanation, the data model used, and some sample code. Below is an example:

# Height Prediction from Age

This section provides a simple linear regression model to predict height based on age. The example assumes that the relationship between age and height follows a linear pattern, which is common in the growth phase of children and adolescents.

## Data Model

We use a basic linear regression model, which can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Height} = a \times \text{Age} + b \]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are coefficients determined through training on historical data.

## How to Use

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the script to train the model and predict the height for a given age.

3. Modify the `ages` and `heights` arrays with your dataset to fit the model to your specific data.
